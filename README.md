# DataScience
Welcome to my Data Science repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects, research works, and data-driven analyses that showcase my skills and interests in the field of Data Science.

## Projects

### PR_SLA_Age+prediction-https://github.com/Sonu4227/DataScience/blob/main/PR%20SLA%20age%20prediction.ipynb
Requisition to Purchase Order Processing Time Predictor
This project leverages machine learning to predict the time required for the transition from a requisition (PR) to a Purchase Order (PO) in our workflow. By analyzing historical data and relevant features such as code complexity, reviewer response time, and current workload, the model aims to provide accurate estimations. The goal is to enhance project planning and resource allocation, contributing to more efficient and transparent development processes. Explore the predictive insights to optimize workflows and streamline the PR to PO conversion timeline.
