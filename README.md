# DataScience
Welcome to my Data Science repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects, research works, and data-driven analyses that showcase my skills and interests in the field of Data Science.

## Projects

### PR_SLA_Age+prediction-https://github.com/Sonu4227/DataScience/blob/main/PR%20SLA%20age%20prediction.ipynb
Requisition to Purchase Order Processing Time Predictor
This project leverages machine learning to predict the time required for the transition from a requisition (PR) to a Purchase Order (PO) in our workflow. By analyzing historical data and relevant features such as code complexity, reviewer response time, and current workload, the model aims to provide accurate estimations. The goal is to enhance project planning and resource allocation, contributing to more efficient and transparent development processes. Explore the predictive insights to optimize workflows and streamline the PR to PO conversion timeline.

### Telecom_Company_Customer_retention_strategy-https://github.com/Sonu4227/DataScience/blob/main/Telecom_Company_Customer_Retention_Model.ipynb
Another exciting project! 
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Recommendations
This project delves into the trends and patterns associated with customer churn in a telecom company. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning, we analyze extensive customer data to identify key factors contributing to churn. Insights from this analysis allow the telecom company to proactively address issues and implement targeted retention strategies. Our project not only diagnoses the reasons behind customer exits but also provides actionable recommendations for reducing churn rates. Together, these insights empower the company to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, fostering long-term relationships in the dynamic telecom industry.
